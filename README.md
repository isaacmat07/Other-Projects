Incomplete Wordle Game utilizing jTextFields, jButtoms, Graphics, cardLayout, multiple jFrames/Panels. Allows user to type in a 6 letter guess and guess will show up on the botton of the screen along with corresponding colored letter boxes.
Green= Correct Letter in Correct Index
Yellow= Letter is in word, however Wrong Index
Red= Letter is not in the word
Soon I will update the GUI and add a congratulations screen in a new jFrame as well as randomize words
